                <h3>DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT:  Eve A. Ma</h3>
                <p>I made this documentary in order to bring greater recognition to the Afro-Peruvian community and the performance arts it has created.  In the process, I have tried to show how a community can rise above horrific circumstances to create a thing of beauty.</p>

                <h3>AFRO-PERUVIANS:</h3>
                <p>For more than 200 years, starting in the early 16th century, there was slavery in Peru, mostly people kidnapped from Africa who had first been brought to the eastern coast of South America and then taken to Peru.  The descendants of these people are today’s Afro-Peruvians,:  people fully Peruvian but with a lively cultural tradition of their own which includes music and dance.<br><br>

                The documentary includes lots of performance along with interviews, on-location footage, photographs and a host’s narration.  Our star is LaloIzquierdo, a dancer, choreographer, percussionist and folklorist of his community.  Filmed in the USA and in Peru, it is in SD (the square format image).<br><br>

                We’d like to express out special thanks to LaloIzquierdo, Carlos López, Edith Maldonado and Juan Medrano Cotito.</p>
